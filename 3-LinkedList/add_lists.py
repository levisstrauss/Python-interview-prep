"""
Write a function, add_lists, that takes in the head of two linked lists,
 each representing a number. The nodes of the linked lists contain digits
  as values. The nodes in the input lists are reversed; this means that
  the least significant digit of the number is the head. The function should
   return the head of a new linked listed representing the sum of the input
   lists. The output list should have its digits reversed as well
